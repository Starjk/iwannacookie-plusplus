Respawn, Boss and Mobility in Prio
Manage Respawn and Upgrades
Manage Boss Creation and Interaction (class Boss : public Foe)
Manage Enemy type and mobility value | Weapon type too
Manage Fading effect better (starter to manage animation? maybe explosion later on)
Add Musics and Sounds (with Fmod?)
